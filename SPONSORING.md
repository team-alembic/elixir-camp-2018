# Sponsoring Elixir Camp

## Overview

### Join a community of antipodean Elixirists!

Elixir Camp is a not for profit technology event run by volunteers twice per year in Australia. The Australian Elixir community is delighted to offer you the opportunity to become a sponsor for Elixir Camp IV at Camp Wombaroo, Mittagong on October 2018.

The Elixir community in Australia is growing steadily. This year we expect over 65 passionate Elixir professionals and enthusiasts to converge for a weekend of presentations, lightning talks, workshops and hacking.

Sponsoring this event will give your company an opportunity to support a growing community and promote your brand and services.

Building on the success of past events, this camp will be held at Camp Wombaroo near Mittagong in New South Wales.

## What happens at an Elixir Camp?

An Elixir Camp strives to be a fun, friendly educational technology focussed event. Attendees will arrive by a coach to the camp in the late afternoon on Friday. There'll be some housekeeping, announcements and sponsor shout outs to make and the attendees will have the opportunity to socialise.

The main hall will serve as a hacking space with power points provided. On Saturday and Sunday there will be a mix of pre-announced and unannounced talks and workshops run by attendees in dedidicated areas equipped with a projector. Campers can choose to attend as few or as many talks as they wish. They may choose to hack on a side project or simply socialise with other members of the community.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be catered. Friday evening will kick off with an opening BBQ! Snacks will be provided between meals. Alcohol will not be provided but campers are welcome to supply to their own.

Sufficient dormatory accomodation will be provided for all attendees, however those that wish to camp are welcome to do so.

Sunday evening will conclude with presentations on all the fun stuff that the campers have built over the weekend, followed by some closing housekeeping and sponsor shout outs!
